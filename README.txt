How to play:

- The game can be played with a mouse and/or a keyboard. 
- Using the mouse, the user can click anywhere on a square to select it. 
- If the square has no unit occupying it, nothing will happen. 
- If the square has a unit, the square will be highlighted red. 
- This action can also be done with the keyboard by typing the cell co-ordinate based off the x-y axes notation. ie: pressing '4' then 'a' will select the 1st column in the 4th row (cell: 4a). Note that lower case and upper case is accepted, and invalid inputs are disregarded.
- With a unit selected, the player can move that unit to any cell on the entire chess grid by either clicking with a mouse or using the keyboard.
- The selected chess piece will move to that destination square and if the designated square has a piece on it, it will die.
- The player can control both black and white pieces.
- No rules of Chess are enforced.

r/R: Read a file Input

The program is able to read and play out a series of moves in a file "positions.txt" in the /data folder. The format of each step is important for it to properly work. The format is as follows:

1a>4b

Where '1a' is the first position, followed by a '>' symbol and then the next position. Any invalid positions are disregarded.
